        <p class="">Historically, the fundamental role of pharmacists as a healthcare practitioner was to check and
            distribute drugs to doctors for medication that had been prescribed to patients. In more modern times,
            pharmacists advise patients and health care providers on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side
            effects of medications,
